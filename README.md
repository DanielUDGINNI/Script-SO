# Script-SO
This Python script allows for managing various operating system options, such as IP address configuration, SMB protocol settings, and user administration activities.

<p>The definition of a script tells us that it is a programming code, usually simple, that contains commands or instructions that are executed sequentially. Scripts are commonly used to control the behavior of a specific program or to interact with the operating system. In Windows, they are known as batch files with the .bat extension, and they are interpreted through the command line (MS-DOS). They are based on the same principles as in UNIX, where scripts can be identified by the .bash and .sh extensions they use.</p>

<p>Scripts serve many purposes; in fact, it can be said that they have practically infinite utility. From web development to a software plug-in or a function you want to add to a corporate website, all of these are aspects that can be addressed by implementing a script.</p>
